Minicraft+ version 1.9.4

* Almost total revision of lighting; surface level now has lighting overlay sometimes, and the colors all around may be slightly different.
+ Daylight now increases and decreases more smoothly; steadily goes from dark to light in the morning, and light to dark in the evening.

+ Added Instant Health Potion! Instantly refills up to 5 hearts.
* changed death chest expire times; easy:30min, norm:10min, hard:2min
* Sped up game speed while sleeping.
- Prevented Airwizard from being removed during daily entity clear.
* Increased Torch light radius; also, torches now work the same way on the surface as they do in the caves.
+ Added missingTexture sprite.
* Changed the name of a couple items (was abbreviated).
+ Wool slows down all mobs except you.
+ Added some more help messages when trying do things that you might not know you can't do yet. (destroying hardrock, obsidian stair on lava level).
+ Imposed a limit to the number of mobs that can spawn on a level, dependent on the level and the game difficulty.

+ Added small tweak for creative mode: empty buckets will remain empty, so you can empty the ocean as much as you like. Full buckets remain full, as well.
+ Additional creative mode tweak: "attacking" mob spawner with hand changes the level of mob it spawns. Also, you can pick up spawners in creative mode.
+ Creative mode inventory remains full.

+ Key controls displayed on (hopefully) all menus will always be correct. ;)
* Revised some key binding details to hopefully prevent inability to select anything. Also, added feature to reset all key bindings to default.

+ You can now copy world saves.
+ Added another confirm dialog before deleting worlds.
+ Player score shown on-screen in score mode. TIP: as you probably don't know... you can unlock new time limits for score mode. unlock 10min by getting 1000 points in a 20min game, and unlock 2Hour by getting 100,000 points in a 1Hour game. (Hint: defeating the AirWizard gives you 100,000 points...)

Minicraft+ version 1.9.3

+ added command line argument to change the save directory of the world files.
* revised input system to (hopefully) work on any language keyboard/computer.
+ added back feature where mobs stay away during the first night.
* Reduced world load time from 2 seconds to about half a second, for me). It used to generate new levels needlessly, but now it doesn't.
+ Loading has a progress bar. Though honestly, it doesn't need one.


Minicraft+ version 1.9.2

* HUGE renovations to the code; might not see many changes to functionality, but entirely new bugs are bound to crop up...
* renovated entities
* renovated menus, a bit
+ added Key Binding Menu, finally! You can now customize key controls, and save them. Accessible from the title screen, and the pause menu.
+ added spanish keyboard(/computer?) support... for the enter (and backspace) key... but that's all you need to access and change the key binding menu.
+ Key bindings, sound, and autosave options are loaded on startup, in a special file that applies to all saves; like beating the second airwizard.
+ world difficulty is saved for each world


Minicraft+ version 1.9.1

= Armor now functions as a damage buffer rather than extra hearts; you take damage after only a certain number of damage points accumulate.
+ Armor lasts longer.
= Rate of hunger bar healing health depends on hunger; still happens when less than full health.
- removed player's restriction on movement while being hurt
+ Added version number to save file
+ Hunger bar now decreases in a better way (in my opinion)
# fixed all the bugs I could find!


Minicraft+ version 1.9

=Everything reimplemented
=stuff works
+Game window is resizable
+more entries in debug display
+added debug features
+key preferences... well, kinda. You can't really change them...

+added obsidian brick and door to creative inventory
