Ideas for ways to update or improve existing features.
----
[ ] Design a system where cloud tiles respawn around existing cloud tiles if the total number of cloud tiles is below a certain number.
[X] Limit the number of airwizards at one time to 3. (limited all bosses to 1)
[~] Give the player 20 health instead of 10; this means that 1 health will be a half of a heart. (Done by different approach)
[ ] Make arrows go away after hitting a certain number of enemies, or dealing a certain amount of damage.
[ ] Make creeper holes like TNT, just only one block. Though I should still have the thing where it hurts entities based on distance.
[ ] Check light levels for mob spawning below ground, as well as above ground. But spawners will still spawn mobs. But it should check to make sure it doesn't spawn a mob on top of another. Basically, try to have some way for players to "turn off" a mob spawner without destroying it.
[ ] Make respawn without bed += 20 blocks x/y of last spawn.
[ ] Enchantments
[X] Allow clients to add a port number to the end of the ip with ":". for example: 12.34.145.1:1122
[X] Obsidan Dungeon Update that will extend the storyline, add a new boss and maybe a miniboss.
