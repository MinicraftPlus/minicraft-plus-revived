Ideas for ways to update or improve existing features.
------

Add a feature where the player is knocked back when mobs attack them, but not by water or lava. So... well, actually, anything that's self-inflicted, and nothing else. So, hunger, water, and lava, don't knock back, but everthing else should.

----

make the quick-save key configurable.

----

Make it so cloud tiles can be placed in the sky level, on empty air tiles.
-
Design a system where cloud tiles respawn around existing cloud tiles if the total number of cloud tiles is below a certain number.

----

limit the number of airwizards at one time to 3.

----

Give the player 20 health instead of 10; this means that 1 health will be a half of a heart.

----

Make it so a hoe on grass turns it into dirt, but with a *much* higher chance of producing seeds; like, maybe 95%

----

Make it so the world loading menu displays both a percentage and a message saying what it is doing, ie, "Generating surface level..."

----

Add little black tics to the tile in front of you, so you know which tile things like planks and walls will be placed on.

----

allow creative mode player to walk in sky without clouds.

----

Allow clients to add a port number to the end of the ip with ":". for example: 12.34.145.1:1122

----

make arrows go away after hitting a certain number of enemies, or dealing a certain amount of damage

----

make creeper holes like TNT, just only one block. Though I should still have the thing where it hurts entities based on distance.

----

check light levels for mob spawning below ground, as well as above ground. But spawners will still spawn mobs. But it should check to make sure it doesn't spawn a mob on top of another. Basically, try to have some way for players to "turn off" a mob spawner without destroying it.

----

Make respawn without bed += 20 blocks x/y of last spawn.
