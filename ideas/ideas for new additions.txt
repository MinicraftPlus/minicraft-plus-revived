Ideas for entirely new features not previously part of the game.
++++
[ ] Invisibility potion: Allows you to go through walls, but lava will still hurt you. If you get stuck in a wall, you will begin to take suffocation damage as in Minecraft.
[ ] Ragdoll potion: Allows you to control other mobs, but not other players.
++++
[ ] Add signs. So, when you walk over them, a message is displayed!
[ ] Add maps. Possible crafting recipe: bones and leather. One for each level on the smallest world size, and progressively more maps should be needed otherwise. Should I make the maps lock to "chuck" sort of locations, or always make the center the current location, where possible? It could work by having a mini-map in the upper-left whenever the map is the active item, and there is no menu open.
[ ] Bone meal to make trees grow. Though I might make something else that has the same functionality, instead.
[ ] tipped/enchanted arrows
[ ] fire
[ ] fireballs
[ ] Jukeboxes / noteblocks.
[ ] Bacon.
[ ] Milk & bad status effects.
[ ] Boats; though I don't see them being *too* useful without infinite terrain and vast oceans...
++++
[ ] add controller support
[ ] Make beds colorable
[ ] Add world backup option, that user can select a download location. Then maybe... pack to zip? Also, I'll need to make a "restore" feature, and unzip it, so this could get complicated...
[ ] Custom skins
[ ] World editors
++++
[ ] Add giants, and make them eat trees.
[ ] make friendly mobs able to be fed and bred, and led.
