Ideas I'm not sure I want to implement.
??????

Change the lighting in caves; maybe I could experiment with having surface lighting, but just really, really low...?

????

I guess maybe make a system of item attributes? Entity attributes? Even tile attributes? Item attributes could be for making beds colorable...

????

Make lapis do more. Maybe lapis tools, that make everything drop more items?

????

Add feature to notifications display: if it starts with ":error:", then make the text red (but don't show the ":Error:" part). Any further than that, though, and it would be better to just pass it in.

????

Add a feature so that a changelog will be displayed if on lower version...?

????

What about a zoomin-zoomout feature?
And if you zoomed out far enough clouds would obstruct your view
