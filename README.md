# Minicraft Plus
Minicraft+ is a modded version of Minicraft that adds many more features to the original version. To learn more about Minicraft, or play it yourself, take a look at all the [releases](https://github.com/chrisj42/minicraft-plus-revived/releases).

The code was a bit of a mess at first due to inexperience and several years of abandonment. Now it works pretty well; though there's still some to do, and the code still isn't perfect, but hopefully it will get there eventually.

## Major Features
Here is a small share of the more major features that this mod adds to the original minicraft game:
* More Game modes -- Creative, Hardcore, and Score mode in addition to Survival
* Save / Load System for worlds and settings, and respawn after death
* World creation and management options, such as name, size, and terrain type of world, and rename, delete, and copy world
* Multiplayer mode, complete with dedicated server support, with or without a GUI, as well as an online account system
* Many more mobs
* Many more tiles
* More weapons / tools, such as claymores and torches
* Many more items, such as Potions and Buckets
* Personal crafting menu
* Beds
* Mob Spawners (with loot chests)
* An expanded storyline; 4th dungeon level, and Second Boss
* Bigger/Resizable screen size
* Key Binding customization, so you can change the key controls
* Tutorials
* Localization: Different languages

You can find a more comprehensive list of the earlier versions, before 1.9, in [this minecraft forum post](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/off-topic/general-gaming/452036-v1-6-minicraft-plus). Be aware however, that it's old; it's from many years ago before the project was abandoned.

##### Features that Chris J added to the mod:
* Rename, copy world options
* Multiplayer mode
* Resizable screen size
* Key Binding customization, so you can change the key controls
* Saved settings
* Ability to drop items
* Surface lighting being much more gradual, and not stuck to 4 increments.
* Improvements to mob spawning, including mob despawning, mob count caps, and variable mob spawning rates
* Many other tidbits and improvements

### Current Goals

Things we plan on implementing, _hopefully_ sooner rather than later...
* Bugfixes and cleanup

### Ideas for future additions

Things we will probably add later, rather than sooner.

* Add back Experience bar, from version 1.4

#### Far, far away...

These are simply **ideas**, and have no guarantee of being implemented any time soon, or even at all. Could be becuase they're complicated, or could be because I just haven't bothered considering them yet
If their implementation becomes more likely, they will be moved to a different section.

* Custom Skins
* Redstone
* Fire
* Chickens
* Minecarts
* World editors
* Boats, because they require infinite terrain and vast oceans
