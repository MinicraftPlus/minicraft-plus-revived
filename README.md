# minicraft-plus-revived
Minicraft+, a modded version of minicraft that adds many more features to the original version. To learn more about minicraft, or play it yourself, take a look at [www.playminicraft.com](https://www.playminicraft.com).

The code was a bit of a mess at first, due to inexperience and several years of abandonment, but after a number of months, I'm finally more or less happy with it. Currently, the focus has shifted to a popular and greatly requested feature: Multiplayer mode! This will be quite the adventure, as I'm starting with no experience with networking and such in Java. But I'll try! XD

## Major Features
Here is a small share of the more major features that this mod adds to the original minicraft game:
* More Game modes -- Creative, Hardcore, and Score mode in addition to Survival
* Save / Load System for worlds and settings, and respawn after death
* World creation and management options, such as name, size, and terrain type of world, and rename, delete, and copy world
* Many more mobs
* Many more tiles
* More weapons / tools, such as claymores and torches
* Many more items, such as Potions and Buckets
* Personal crafting menu
* Beds
* Mob Spawners (with loot chests)
* expanded storyline; 4th dungeon level, and Second Boss
* Bigger/Resizable screen size
* Key Binding customization, so you can change the key controls


You can find a more comprehensive list of the earlier versions, before 1.9, in [this minecraft forum post](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/off-topic/general-gaming/452036-v1-6-minicraft-plus). Be aware however, that it's old; it's from many years ago before the project was abandoned.

### Current Goals

Things I plan on implementing, _hopefully_ sooner rather than later... ;)

* Tutorial... less-than-6-year-old one coming eventually!

* Add some nice music! Maybe pixely... we're working on that now, sort-of.

* Make it so cloud tile can be placed in the sky level, on empty air tiles. Otherwise, they're useful for nothing...

* ...Find lots more in the other text files above.

### Ideas for future additions

Things I will probably add later, rather than sooner.

* Auto-update system -- though, I might move this up, if this actually becomes something many people use.
* Add back Experience bar, from version 1.4

#### Far, far away...

These are simply **ideas**, and have no guarantee of being implemented any time soon, or even at all. Could be becuase they're complicated, or could be because I just haven't bothered considering them yet. :P
If their implementation becomes more likely, they will be moved to a different section.

* Multiplayer *Servers*
  * Custom usernames
  * Custom Skins
* Redstone
* Fire
* Chickens
* Minecarts
* Milk & bad status effects
* World editors
