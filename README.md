### Current Goals

For current goals, as well as ideas, read "Bugs and things to do.txt", and the other stuff in the "ideas" folder.

#### Far, far away...

These are simply **ideas**, and have no guarantee of being implemented any time soon, or even at all. Could be becuase they're complicated, or could be because I just haven't bothered considering them yet
If their implementation becomes more likely, they will be moved to a different section.

* Redstone
* Fire
* Chickens
* Minecarts
* World editors
* Boats, because they require infinite terrain and vast oceans
