	---Quick TODO's---

-reorder tools a bit in ToolType.java b/c I'm picky. Hoes should be first, at least. ;)
- add to F3 menu: "heartticks" left until regen another heart.

Note to self: for more little bugs/ideas/concerns, search code for "TODO"

	####BUGS####

Fire particles appear, but... they look totally weird...
####
Sound effects don't always play when they should; mostly it seems when other sounds should be on at the same time.

	****IDEAS(that should probably be implemented)****
****

Add world backup option to world load menu; it could be complicated, since if I add a world backup option, I would have to add a world restore option, too...

****

Make respawn without bed += 20 blocks x/y of last spawn.

****

Go over all the "Warnings" from Xlint, and fix them.

****

My idea for the new tile data system:
Have Tiles.java store an Array list of Arrays, the first one for tile id, and the inner array to represent a data type. I haven't decided what data type the inner array should be; could be int (direct to save file), String (direct to read), or Enum (direct to save and read, but many enums and *might* not work).
To save, maybe I should separate this data from other data like health, and put it directly in the ids file. Maybe put it as id_data, both integers here for sure. And for referencing in tiles.get, same deal: "name_data". This shows just how nice enums would be. I hope they work.

****

Add world backup option, that user can select a download location. Then maybe... pack to zip? Also, I'll need to make a "restore" feature, and unzip it ...

****

change inventory system to better allow moving items to and from inventories, into chests; for example, you should be able to choose how much of an item stack you want to transfer.

*?*?*?* Questionable Improvements (But still seem important)*?*?*?*

LegacyLoad class is becoming annoying to handle; it should be reimplemented so that it won't have to be changed at all to reflect future updates. This could be done by making it only return values, and not actually reference any current variables. This may prove overcomplicated, though.

IDEA: Let's make an "Update.java" file, maybe multiple, that handle different versions. However, instead of setting values in the rest of the game files, it will be set up as a "getter" sort of thing, where it doesn't reference all the game vars in full detail; but, it fetches them in the way that needs to be, for the main Load class. Basically, I want to have Load.java run everytime, but all the things that would otherwise be copied to LegacyLoad just stay in Load.java, and Load.java will "call" certain methods of LegacyLoad, to setup something the way it used to be.
Yeah, it's fishy, but.... there we go.
