	---Quick TODO's---

--CURRENT: 

 - move Save/Load stuff into FileData enum; use it to call each method
 - move all the old loading code into another LegacyLoad class (rename them to reflect their versions)
 - add feature to save multiple multiplayer users and ip addresses
 - check that score mode works in multiplayer, I have a feeling that the clients might not see the correct score...
 

Note to self: for more little bugs/ideas/concerns, search code for "TODO"

	****IDEAS(that should probably be implemented)****
****

Make an Interactable interface, and both Entity AND Tile implement it, because both are interactable. Interactable holds methods for things like collision detection, tangibility, events for touching, and events for player key presses like interact ("v") and attack (that will also pickup furniture; it's sort of like, "swipe"). There will be a dedicated button to open the inventory. intereact will open chests, activate tnt, etc.

****

change "xa" and "ya" to something else; b/c they are NOT accelerations! They're distances! Specifically, they are the distance that a given entity is about to move.

****

Add more colors? Or try and turn sprites into 32x32 (currently are 16x16) for better graphics? Also, change game aspect ratio from 4:3 to 16:9. This probably means searching for hard-coding refs to the screen size, and changing them. Also make smaller font size, for chat and debug.

****

COULD BE IRRELEVANT DUE TO UPCOMING RENDERING OVERHAUL
make it so all tile sprites are calculated only once, then get updated whenever something happens in an adjacent tile. Might help especially with ConnectorSprites, I think. To do this, I'll just have to make an update method in the Tile class, and somehow save the last generated sprite..?

****

make the text when typing a world name become uppercase according to English locale.

****

Go over all the "Warnings" from Xlint, and fix them.

****

reorder tools a bit in ToolType.java b/c I'm picky. Hoes should be first, at least. ;)

****

add to F3 menu: "heartticks" left until regen another heart.
