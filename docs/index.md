Be aware however, that it's old; it's from many years ago before the project was originally abandoned, and then subsequently rediscovered 5 years later. :3

#### Far, far away...

These are simply **ideas**, and have no guarantee of being implemented any time soon, or even at all. Could be becuase they're complicated, or could be because I just haven't bothered considering them yet
If their implementation becomes more likely, they will be moved to a different section.

* Custom Skins
* Redstone
* Fire
* Chickens
* Minecarts
* World editors
* Boats, because they require infinite terrain and vast oceans
