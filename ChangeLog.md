>
>

>     + Made enchanter craftable.
>     - removed enchanter and workbench from starting inventory.
>     - removed the power glove. It's still used, but you can only use it by pressing the "pickup" key ("v" by default); you can't get it in your inventory.
>     + Added "unknown" item to make it obvious when something has gone wrong; it has the requested name, but the sprite is a pink square.
>     * Fixed multiplayer attack rendering across clients; now shows attack, including the item a client is attacking with.
>     * Fixed creative inventory for clients in multiplayer.
>     * Fixed multiplayer client saving.
>     - removed all the "frozen mobs" which kept appearing in multiplayer
>     * Fixed unlocked score mode times not appearing until you restarted the game; you shouldn't have to restart it now.
>     + Added F3 menu for the server instance of the game in multiplayer.
>     * Patched possible duplicate usernames glitch
>
>
>     Minicraft+ version 2.0.1
>
>     +* added more super-secret debug powers... mua ha ha...
>     + added to F3 window: level mobcount + max mobcount, and name of current tile
>     + Arrows now appear in your inventory
>     * Fixed crafting; correct number of items are used
>     * Creepers shouldn't be able to blow up stairs anymore
>     * Bed spawning should now work; once you sleep in a bed, you will always spawn from the place that you were standing right before you got in bed, unless that spot later becomes rock, or something else a player can't walk through. The bed does not have to remain where it is; you can destroy it, and you will continue to spawn in the spot described above.
>     * Fixed Save folder for non-windows users. You may notice a strange folder called "null" in the same folder as the minicraft jar. Move the ".playminicraft" folder inside to your home directory, and it should recognize it again. It may be hidden due to the "."
>     * This version should be compatible with 1.8 save files.
>     * Edited the mob spawning algorithm, so mobs should not spawn at such a crazy speed as before
>
>     * Renovated Multiplayer! It should now be much less laggy. Still not quite tolerable, but... better.
>     + Added multiplayer feature: when hosting a server, a new window opens up for you to play as any other player, though your settings will be saved so that your should be able to continue as normal if you load the world as single player again. The server window lets you view the players connected, and change world difficulty and such.
>     + Added multiplayer feature: the inventory and such data for people connected to the server is saved in a seperate file along with the computer's MAC address, so if they connect with that computer again, their inventory and stats should be restored.
>
>     * Ensured that most all the normal world features work in multiplayer. However, I have not been able to do much testing with Client Player saves, so that might not work very well. Everything else should work, though; but the connection lag between computers may cause some wierd effects. Fixing this lag is my next goal.
>
>
>     Minicraft+ version 2.0.0
>
>     +++ MULTIPLAYER MODE now supported! (dun, dun-dun-dun!)
>     -*- Well... kind of. I got one way to work, but it's super laggy.
>
>     *** mostly, just lots and lots of important bug fixes, such as:
>     * You disappear from the level when you get in bed, as you should
>     * you can now see the edges of the level
>     * crafting furniture no longer disappears upon loading a pre-existing world
>     * Stackable item count decreases as it should
>
>
>     ---------------------------------------------------------
>
>     Minicraft+ version 1.9.4
>
>     * Almost total revision of lighting; surface level now has lighting overlay sometimes, and the colors all around may be slightly different.
>     + Daylight now increases and decreases more smoothly; steadily goes from dark to light in the morning, and light to dark in the evening.
>

>     * changed death chest expire times; easy:30min, norm:10min, hard:2min
>     * Sped up sleeping game speed.
>     - Prevented Airwizard from being removed during daily entity clear.

>     + Added missingTexture sprite.
>     * Changed the name of a couple items (was abbreviated).
>     + Wool slows down all mobs except you.
>     + Added some more help messages when trying do things that you might not know you can't do yet. (destroying hardrock, obsidian stair on lava level).
>     + Imposed a limit to the number of mobs that can spawn on a level, dependent on the level and the game difficulty.
>
>     + Added small tweak for creative mode: empty buckets will remain empty, so you can empty the ocean as much as you like. Full buckets remain full, as well.
>     + Additional creative mode tweak: "attacking" mob spawner with hand changes the level of mob it spawns. Also, you can pick up spawners in creative mode.
>     + Creative mode inventory remains full.
>
>     + Key controls displayed on (hopefully) all menus will always be correct. ;)
>     * Revised some key binding details to hopefully prevent inability to select anything. Also, added feature to reset all key bindings to default.
>
>     + You can now copy world saves.
>     + Added another confirm dialog before deleting worlds.
>     + Player score shown on-screen in score mode. TIP: as you probably don't know... you can unlock new time limits for score mode. unlock 10min by getting 1000 points in a 20min game, and unlock 2Hour by getting 100,000 points in a 1Hour game. (Hint: defeating the AirWizard gives you 100,000 points...)
>
>     Minicraft+ version 1.9.3
>
>     + added command line argument to change the save directory of the world files.
>     * revised input system to (hopefully) work on any language keyboard/computer.
>     + added back feature where mobs stay away during the first night.
>     * Reduced world load time from 2 seconds to about half a second, for me). It used to generate new levels needlessly, but now it doesn't.
>     + Loading has a progress bar. Though honestly, it doesn't need one.
>
>
>     Minicraft+ version 1.9.2
>
>     * HUGE renovations to the code; might not see many changes to functionality, but entirely new bugs are bound to crop up...
>     * renovated entities
>     * renovated menus, a bit
>     + added Key Binding Menu, finally! You can now customize key controls, and save them. Accessible from the title screen, and the pause menu.
>     + added spanish keyboard(/computer?) support... for the enter (and backspace) key... but that's all you need to access and change the key binding menu.
>     + Key bindings, sound, and autosave options are loaded on startup, in a special file that applies to all saves; like beating the second airwizard.
>     + world difficulty is saved for each world
>
>
>     Minicraft+ version 1.9.1
>
>     = Armor now functions as a damage buffer rather than extra hearts; you take damage after only a certain number of damage points accumulate.
>     + Armor lasts longer.
>       = Rate of hunger bar healing health depends on hunger; still happens when less than full health.
>     - removed player's restriction on movement while being hurt
>     + Added version number to save file
>     + Hunger bar now decreases in a better way (in my opinion)
>     # fixed all the bugs I could find!
>
>
>     Minicraft+ version 1.9
>
>     =Everything reimplemented
>     =stuff works
>     +Game window is resizable
>     +more entries in debug display
