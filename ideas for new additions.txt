 -------- Simple Ideas --------

----

Make it so cloud tile can be placed in the sky level, on empty air tiles. Otherwise, they're useful for nothing...

----

limit the number of airwizards at one time to 3.

----

Bacon. Just, Bacon.

----

Requested: Change the lighting in caves. maybe I could experiment with having surface lighting, but just really, really low.

----

Make a invisibility potion. This will allow you to go through walls, but lava will still hurt you. If you get stuck in a wall, you will begin to take suffocation damage as in Minecraft.

----

change "xa" and "ya" to something else; b/c they are NOT accelerations! They're distances! Specifically, they are the distance that a given entity is about to move.

----

Make the "sticky keys" feature off by default on survival, and on by default on creative.

----

Give the player 20 health instead of 10; this means that 1 health will be a half of a heart.

 ++++++++ More Complicated Ideas ++++++++

++++

Add some Easter eggs into the game, like Christmas graphics or something.

++++

Jukeboxes / noteblocks. Maybe use DeterminationIsAlive music for this..? Speaking of music, minicraft flash on playminicraft.com/online has the perfect game music... I want it so bad...

++++

Request Message: Add a map in the game craftable with bones and leather and add some bone meal it is used to make trees grow faster and add some new arrows (note: I'll need sprites.)

++++

Add lasers! And glass! But, like, triangle glass, so the laser can bounce off things. And, if you concentrate 3+ lasers, it will do damage... What about coloring? I think a prism glass block should be added to difract it into 3 colors (prob rgb), one going in each of the three other directions.

++++

Make lapis do more. Maybe lapis tools, that make everything drop more items?

++++

add minecarts. And rails. Will probably start out powered by normal player movement.

++++

add fireballs...

++++

add controller support

++++

Make beds colorable. This will probably consist of making an item attribute to make the item colorable.

++++

Related to the above... I guess maybe make a system of item attributes? Entity attributes? Even tile attributes?

++++

Add maps to the game. One for each level on the smallest world size, and progressively more maps should be needed otherwise. Should I make the maps lock to "chuck" sort of locations, or always make the center the current location, where possible? It could work by having a mini-map in the upper-left whenever the map is the active item, and there is no menu open.

++++

Add more decorations that have no actual function...? Like furniture: chairs, tables, etc.

++++

make friendly mobs able to be fed and bred.

++++

Design a system where cloud tiles respawn around existing cloud tiles if the total number of cloud tiles is below a certain number.

++++

Find something to do with Npc.java, and Giant.java; currently, they were never even implemented in the first place, even though they were made...

++++

Turn player.score into the experience system of 1.4; or, maybe I should just make my own experience system... it wouldn't hurt to use things like colors and such from 1.4, though.

 ???????? Questionable Ideas ????????

????

Add a feature so that a changelog will be displayed if on lower version...?

????

Add feature to notifications display: if it starts with ":error:", then make the text red (but don't show the ":Error:" part). Any further than that, though, and it would be better to just pass it in.

????

Make a way to resize the font... In specific instances only, though, I'm thinking. For example, the F3 overlay.

????

Make menu frames change size based on the largest (text) item in it. Not totally sure I want to do it...
