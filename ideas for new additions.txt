 -------- Simple Ideas --------

----

Make it so cloud tile can be placed in the sky level, on empty air tiles. Otherwise, they're useful for nothing...

----

Bacon. Just, Bacon.

----

Remove the PowGlove entirely, in favor of a new control key, like "v", to "pickup" things. Perhaps, make it only work when nothing is in your hand?

----

Requested: Change the lighting in caves. maybe I could experiment with having surface lighting, but just really, really low.

----

Make a invisibility potion. This will allow you to go through walls, but lava will still hurt you. If you get stuck in a wall, you will begin to take suffocation damage as in Minecraft.

----

change "xa" and "ya" to something else; b/c they are NOT accelerations! They're distances! Specifically, they are the distance that a given entity is about to move.

----

Make the "sticky keys" feature off by default on survival, and on by default on creative.

----

Give the player 20 health instead of 10; this means that 1 health will be a half of a heart.

 ++++++++ More Complicated Ideas ++++++++

++++

Make beds colorable. This will probably consist of making an item attribute to make the item colorable.

++++

Related to the above... I guess maybe make a system of item attributes? Entity attributes? Even tile attributes?

++++

Add more decorations that have no actual function...? Like furniture: chairs, tables, etc.

++++

make friendly mobs able to be fed and bred.

++++

Add a system to more properly find the home/data dir on different OS's; windows doesn't regconize "."[filename] as hidden, I think, so that should be accounted for as well.	

++++

Design a system where cloud tiles respawn around existing cloud tiles if the total number of cloud tiles is below a certain number.

++++

Find something to do with Npc.java, and Giant.java; currently, they were never even implemented in the first place, even though they were made...

++++

Turn player.score into the experience system of 1.4; or, maybe I should just make my own experience system... it wouldn't hurt to use things like colors and such from 1.4, though.

 ???????? Questionable Ideas ????????

????

Add a feature so that a changelog will be displayed if on lower version...?

????

Add feature to notifications display: if it starts with ":error:", then make the text red (but don't show the ":Error:" part). Any further than that, though, and it would be better to just pass it in.

????

Make a way to resize the font... In specific instances only, though, I'm thinking. For example, the F3 overlay.

????

Make menu frames change size based on the largest (text) item in it. Not totally sure I want to do it...
