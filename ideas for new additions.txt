 -------- Simple Ideas --------

----



----

Make it so cloud tile can be placed in the sky level, on empty air tiles. Otherwise, they're useful for nothing...

----

limit the number of airwizards at one time to 3.

----

Bacon. Just, Bacon.

----

Requested: Change the lighting in caves. maybe I could experiment with having surface lighting, but just really, really low.

----

Make a invisibility potion. This will allow you to go through walls, but lava will still hurt you. If you get stuck in a wall, you will begin to take suffocation damage as in Minecraft.

----

change "xa" and "ya" to something else; b/c they are NOT accelerations! They're distances! Specifically, they are the distance that a given entity is about to move.

----

Make the "sticky keys" feature off by default on survival, and on by default on creative.

----

Give the player 20 health instead of 10; this means that 1 health will be a half of a heart.

----

add an escape potion, that brings you either up one level, or to the surface (haven't decided yet).

----

Make it so a hoe on grass turns it into dirt, but with a *much* higher chance of producing seeds; like, maybe 95%

 ++++++++ More Complicated Ideas ++++++++

++++

Add signs. So, when you walk over them, a message is displayed!

++++

LAZORS
  • laser bridges
  • laser rails
  • laser "Redstone" (and receivers, emitters, etc)
  • laser barriers (poss. selectively permiable)

maybe lasers can be made using the "cloud cactus"?

++++

add a key input (default shift-attack) that charges your attack rather than spamming it. Will probably do as much damage as however many spams you could have done while charging, a full stamina bar's worth; the difference is, you deal the damage all at once.

++++

add key controls to move items around in inventory menu, one up/down, or to the top/bottom of the inventory.

++++

Add some Easter eggs into the game, like Christmas graphics or something.

Add the snake game I made in processing to minicraft as an Easter egg, accessible by typing the Konami code at the about page. Even better, maybe I could have it run a variety of my old games, picking one at random each time the code is entered... :D

++++

Jukeboxes / noteblocks. Maybe use DeterminationIsAlive music for this..? Speaking of music, minicraft flash on playminicraft.com/online has the perfect game music... I want it so bad...

++++

Request Message: Add a map in the game craftable with bones and leather and add some bone meal it is used to make trees grow faster and add some new arrows (note: I'll need sprites.)

++++

Add lasers! And glass! But, like, triangle glass, so the laser can bounce off things. And, if you concentrate 3+ lasers, it will do damage... What about coloring? I think a prism glass block should be added to difract it into 3 colors (prob rgb), one going in each of the three other directions.

++++

Make lapis do more. Maybe lapis tools, that make everything drop more items?

++++

add minecarts. And rails. Will probably start out powered by normal player movement.

++++

add fireballs...

++++

add controller support

++++

Make beds colorable. This will probably consist of making an item attribute to make the item colorable.

++++

Related to the above... I guess maybe make a system of item attributes? Entity attributes? Even tile attributes?

++++

Add giants, and make them eat trees.

++++

Add maps to the game. One for each level on the smallest world size, and progressively more maps should be needed otherwise. Should I make the maps lock to "chuck" sort of locations, or always make the center the current location, where possible? It could work by having a mini-map in the upper-left whenever the map is the active item, and there is no menu open.

++++

Add more decorations that have no actual function...? Like furniture: chairs, tables, etc.

++++

make friendly mobs able to be fed and bred.

++++

Design a system where cloud tiles respawn around existing cloud tiles if the total number of cloud tiles is below a certain number.

++++

Find something to do with Npc.java, and Giant.java; currently, they were never even implemented in the first place, even though they were made...

++++

Turn player.score into the experience system of 1.4; or, maybe I should just make my own experience system... it wouldn't hurt to use things like colors and such from 1.4, though.

++++



 ???????? Questionable Ideas ????????

????

Ragdoll Potion? Allows you to control other mobs, but not other players.

????

Add a feature so that a changelog will be displayed if on lower version...?

????

Add feature to notifications display: if it starts with ":error:", then make the text red (but don't show the ":Error:" part). Any further than that, though, and it would be better to just pass it in.
