[2]
The shamed Knight who was shunned for the use of magic. Unfit to the ways of a knight, yet they sought flames. 
They learnt the way of fire but at the cost of destruction of their home, armor, and burns. Banished from their home to fend in another world.

They found peace in the depth of their prison, where their lifetime discovery was made. They built armor, built a mighty fortress from a hard rock of lava and water.
They mastered the magical arts of flame without burns thanks to their armor. They raised knights and lived in harmory. 

All was well in the depths of the world...until a wizard's hatred for those with "friends" laid ruin...
