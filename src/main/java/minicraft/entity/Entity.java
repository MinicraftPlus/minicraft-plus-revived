	 * The world coordinates for entities is 2048x2048
	 * This is because each tile is 16x16 pixels big
	 * 128 x 16 = 2048.
	 * When ever you see a ">>", it means that it is a right shift operator. This means it shifts bits to the right (making them smaller)
	 * x >> 4 is the equivalent to x / (2^4). Which means it's dividing the X value by 16. (2x2x2x2 = 16)
	 * xt << 4 is the equivalent to xt * (2^4). Which means it's multiplying the X tile value by 16.
	 *
	 * These bit shift operators are used to easily get the X & Y coordinates of a tile that the entity is standing on.
